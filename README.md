## Welcome to my page where I posted mini projects!

### Project 1: [Exploratory Data Analysis](
In this project:
* I made use of a publicly available data from Kaggle, which you can find here: [Marketing Campaign](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodsaldanha/arketing-campaign)
* Prepared the data: 
  *  As most datasets shared on Kaggle, the structure of this was clear (the information being presented in a row-and-column format) and did not need much wrangling.
  *  There were few missing values so it was acceptable to drop those from the dataset. 
* Feature-engineered:
  * The dataset had information about the Year of birth of the customers so it was a no-brainer to calculate their age.
  * I also calculated how long the customers had been with the site for further analysis.
  * I summed up the total amount each customer had spent on all categories.
  * I calculated the number of children in each household (by summing up the number of 'kids' and 'teens' provided).
  * I re-categorized the Marital status and Education level for simplicity.
* Conducted univariate and multivariate exploratory analysis of the variables
